# Check out the [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/25168170-Web-App-Landing-Page) and the [website](https://alpine-cargo.vercel.app) itself!
So, hello again! This is my most recent project, based on a concept for a web app landing page! As you'll see in the templates folder in the files, I *slightly* changed the color palette (only the blue) because I don't know how to work with Photoshop to change the color of the airplane, but I think this one actually looks better than the original!

# Credits
I want to give a **huge** thanks to the people listed below for their help, in one or another way, while I was building the website:
+ **nilaallj** - for this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/nilaallj/pen/dyBLqbV) (even though I removed it for design reasons, but still, thank you so much!);
+ **Kevin Powell** - for your tutorial on YouTube on how to create a [horizontal media scroller](https://youtu.be/3yfswsnD2sw?si=YUhkPY6SI8XCLv2f) and its [CodePen](https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/ExbKBQa?editors=1100).
+ **epic2937** and **heyjes.dev** on Discord for their help in terms of the site's performance!

# What's next?
Another website, of course!
